## Sprites

A Spritesheet gets generated from the raw SVG icons that can be used for the
map.
The icons are mostly from the OpenSeaMap and OpenNauticalChart projects but
edited to have the same size and renamed.

All names are based on the INT-1 standard and the used tags in the OpenSeaMap
data. The cross-references are documented
[in the OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seamarks/INT-1_Cross_Reference).
